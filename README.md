# QUIZAPP

A web quiz app that fetches questions and answers from [Open Trivia DB] (https://opentdb.com/). The data passed on from the API including number of questions, category, difficulty, type as well as user input gets stored in Firebase's Cloud Firestore. The app authenticates users through Firebase and allows users who login to be able to save their quiz reults.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.10. The UI was created with [Angular Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) version 4 and by modifying [Argon Dashboard Angular](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard-angular). 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
